To replicate our results, or use the code to determine your own home's price, you would 
need to get every variable listed for the house, and then implement it into the test and 
train csv files with its own unique ID.  You would then run all of the code, and find the newly
created "Data_Tested" file containing your home with the ID used, and a derieved value for the 
newly added home.
